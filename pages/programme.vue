      <h1>Tentative Programme for Brightcon 2023</h1>

      <h2>Hackathon - Sept 16 & 17</h2>
      <p>
        On September 16 & 17, we will have a hackathon with the
        <a href="https://www.hestia.earth/"> HESTIA team </a>. HESTIA provides
        detailed and validated activity data on agriculture and food supply
        chains (currently the data are from more than 400 published studies and
        35,000 farms). HESTIA also makes available nearly 500 models to gap fill
        farm activity data (e.g., to quantify ruminant grass consumption), to
        estimate agricultural emissions (e.g., N2O emissions related to
        fertiliser application), and to quantify resource uses. It is an
        open-source, open-access project and still in the development and
        testing stage, but is already the largest open dataset and model archive
        in this area. In the hackathon we will focus on integrating HESTIA with
        open LCA software, and simplifying the process of entering data into
        HESTIA.

      <h2>Conference - Sept 18, 19 and 20</h2>
      <p>
        The conference will be a mix of talks, special sessions, and short
        courses. Being there in person is a lot of fun, but this year, with
        support from ecoinvent, we are also offering
        <a href="https://canapii.com">online attendance</a>. Physical attendance
        is limited to 80 people, and we expect it to sell out, as it did last
        year.
      </p>
