      <h2>
        üå±üë©‚Äçüíª Brightcon 2023 - Registration and Talk Submission Now Open! üåçüåø
      </h2>
      <p>
        The theme this year is "Broad Open Sustainability Community", and we
        invite submissions for talks, demonstrations, and special sessions. We
        especially encourage talk submissions from LCA-adjacent domains, such as
        MFA, IO, and Industrial Ecology. As software developers and
        sustainability experts, the open sustainability community has an immense
        power in shaping a sustainable future for our planet. At Brightcon 2023,
        we are committed to exploring innovative ways to combine our technical
        expertise with environmental consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        As in previous years, all talks and sessions should be interactive, with
        Jupyter Notebooks or similar technologies used so that the audience can
        follow along and explore your awesome software and data. This also makes
        for a fantastic experience for those attending, as each talk bridges
        theory with practice and directly engages the audience. You can see

        On September 16 & 17, we will have a hackathon with the
        <a href="https://www.hestia.earth/"> HESTIA team </a>. HESTIA provides
        detailed and validated activity data on agriculture and food supply
        chains (currently the data are from more than 400 published studies and
        35,000 farms). HESTIA also makes available nearly 500 models to gap fill
        farm activity data (e.g., to quantify ruminant grass consumption), to
        estimate agricultural emissions (e.g., N2O emissions related to
        fertiliser application), and to quantify resource uses. It is an
        open-source, open-access project and still in the development and
        testing stage, but is already the largest open dataset and model archive
        in this area. In the hackathon we will focus on integrating HESTIA with
        open LCA software, and simplifying the process of entering data into
        HESTIA.

        The conference itself will take place from September 18-20, and will be
        a mix of talks, special sessions, and short courses. Being there in
        person is a lot of fun, but this year, with support from ecoinvent, we
        are also offering <a href="https://canapii.com">online attendance</a>.
        Physical attendance is limited to 80 people, and we expect it to sell
        out, as it did last year.
